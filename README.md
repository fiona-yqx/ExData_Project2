Hello ExData peer,

Please find in this repository the R code and charts for Project 2 submission. It should contain the following files:

Import_Data.R
Plot 1.R
Plot 2.R
Plot 3.R
Plot 4.R
Plot 5.R
Plot 6.R
plot1.png
plot2.png
plot3.png
plot4.png
plot5.png
plot6.png

Import_Data.R contains the code needed to set up the work directory, packages and data base.

I found this assignment very research oriented and the answers could vary greatly depending on personal interpretation. So if you have any questions or comments please feel free to let me know!

Happy grading!

Thanks,
Qingxin
